TCS Question.2 Solved Question

Office Rostering
Problem Description
Vishal owns a startup with a small team of employees. Vishal noticed a peculiar behaviour by his employees.

Among the employees, they have established some friendships. Every employee has one or more friends in office. Whether one is working from office next day depends on their own and their friend's status today i.e., WFH or WFO.

The behaviour is

When an employee worked from office today (WFO) and exactly 3 of his friends also worked from office, then he will continue to work from office the next day, else he will work from home (WFH) the next day
When an employee worked from home today and less than 3 of his friends worked from office, then he will work from office the next day, else he will continue work from home
On day one everyone will be working from office. Employees mark their attendance when they come to the office. Rostering over R days is defined as the total number of employees who attended the office during these R days.

Given the friendship connections of employees and an integer K, determine how many days it will take to reach a rostering value of K, following the rules.

Constraints
3 < N, M < 30

1 < K < 50

Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and M, representing the number of employees and the total number of friendships among them.

The next M lines contain two space-separated integers representing IDs of two employees who are friends.

Last line consists of a single integer K, denoting the rostering value that should be achieved.

Output
Single integer denoting the number of days it will take to achieve the rostering value K.

Time Limit (secs)
1

Examples
Example 1

Input

4 5

1 3

3 2

0 3

0 1

2 1

8

Output

3

Explanation

From the input it is seen that there are 4 employees and 5 connections. Employee 0 is friends with 1,3; 1 is friends with 0, 2, 3; 2 is friends with 1,3; 3 is friends with 0, 1, 2. Rostering value required to be achieved is 8.

On Day 1everyone will work from office, the rostering value achieved day one is 4.

On Day 2 employees 1 and 3 will work from office, as they have 3 friends and all 3 worked from office last day. Employees 0 and 2 will work from home as they have less than 3 of their friends who worked from office last day. Since two employees will work from office on day 2, rostering value achieved including day two is 6.

On Day 3, employees 1 and 3 will work from home, since less than 3 of their friends worked from office last day. Employees 0 and 2 will work from office as they have less than 3 of their friends who worked from office last day. Thus, rostering value achieved including day 3 is 8.

Rostering value has been reached on day 3, hence the output 3.

Example 2

Input

5 7

1 4

0 4

0 1

3 2

3 4

2 0

1 3

15

Output

5

Explanation

From input it is seen that are 5 employees and 7 connections, 15 is the rostering value needed to be reached.

On Day 1: All employees will work from office; rostering value at end of the day is 5.

On Day 2: Employees 1, 3, 4 and 0 will work from office, rostering value at end of the day is 9.

On Day 3: Employees 1, 2 and 4 will work from office, rostering value at end of the day is 12.

On Day 4: All employees will do work from home, rostering value at end of the day is 12.

On Day 5: All employees will work from office, rostering value at end of the day is 17.

On Day 5, since the rostering value target is reached (17 > 15), hence print 5 as output.

                }

                }
            }

            rv -= cfe; // Subtract WFO employees from rostering value
            es = nextStatus; // Update current status for next day
            dc++; // Increment day counter
        }

        System.out.println(dc); // Output days required
        sc.close();
    }
}
